# ToolUpdater
Script written in Windows Batch to update one or multiple binaries regardless where they are saved.

ChatGPT: "This batch file appears to be a tool updater for a program called "yt-dlp.exe". The script searches for the program on all drive letters (A-Z) and, if found, outputs the version number of the program and, if the "UPDATE" variable is set to "true", updates the program. The script uses the "--version" and "-U" flags to check the version number and update the program, respectively. After the update process is complete, the script outputs a message and waits for the user to press any key before exiting."
